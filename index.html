    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Alan Huang. I’m a recent graduate from York University with a B.A. Honours in Computer Science and a GPA of 7.88. I’m fluent in Python, Java, and C. I have knowledge of Algorithms, Data Structures, and Information Networks, and experience with git, RESTful APIs, and FFmpeg.</p>
    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2>Audio Sensibility Google Maps</h2>
    <p>In 2021, I was tasked with building a mini-web application with the goal of displaying customer locations on an embedded Google Map. The application was hosted on Amazon EC2 using Elastic Beanstalk, and used Amazon RDS as the database store.</p>
    <p>The application workflow was fairly sequential. It would do the following steps in the following order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Connect to the Ecwid API, requesting customer data.</li>
      <li>Store customer addresses in a PostgreSQL database using psycopg2.</li>
      <li>Read customer addresses from the database.</li>
      <li>Send those addresses to Google’s geocoding service in order to get the respective latitude and longitude pairs, then store the pairs back into the database.</li>
      <li>Create a KML format file, a format which expresses geographical coordinate data, populating the file with the coordinates of the customers retrieved from the database.</li>
      <li>Create an endpoint to fetch the KML given a region from a list of predefined regions. Additionally, create non-REST endpoints, one that would update the customer database, and one that would update customer coordinates.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>During development, there were many challenges I faced that I had to overcome. I had to learn Amazon Web Services with zero prior knowledge, determining which services were the best for the application. I had to learn how the Ecwid API worked, experimenting with the API to determine the best way to fetch all customer information. I had to learn about database adapters and determining the best one for the task at hand. I had to learn the basics of Google Cloud, learning the steps to register for an API in order to register for the geocoding API. I had to learn the KML format and how to manipulate it using the lxml library. Finally, I had to learn how to create endpoints in the Flask web framework for these functions.</p>
    <h2>Software Design Course Final Project</h2>
    <p>For my final project in the course EECS 3311: Software Design, I was instructed to design a software program based on a specification about a fictional express parking system. The goal of the program was to provide a GUI for System Administrators, parking enforcement officers (PEOs for short), and Customers to perform their respective tasks of this fictional parking system. For example, System Administrators required the ability to add and remove PEOs, and the ability to change the payment status of customer bookings. PEOs required the ability to view the bookings of all customers, the ability to add and remove parking spaces, the ability to grant and cancel parking space booking requests, and the ability to mark bookings as expired. Customers required the ability to register for an account, the ability to book, cancel and pay for a parking space, and the ability to view all of their bookings, both active and expired.</p>
    <p>The javax.swing library was used for the GUI components. WindowBuilder was used to efficiently create each GUI screen. Serialization of the program to keep track of the added PEOs, customers, and bookings was done using the YAML parser of the Jackson Java library.</p>
